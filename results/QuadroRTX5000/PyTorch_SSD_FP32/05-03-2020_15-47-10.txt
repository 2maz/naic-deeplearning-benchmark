WARNING: `ColorTwist` is now deprecated. Use `Hsv/BrightnessContrast` instead
[/opt/dali/dali/operators/color/color_twist.h:181] The Operators: `ColorTwist`, `Hue`, `Saturation`, `Brightness`, `Contrast`, are deprecated, not supported, and will be removed in version 0.20. Please use `BrightnessContrast` and `Hsv` instead.
/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/_reduction.py:43: UserWarning: size_average and reduce args will be deprecated, please use reduction='none' instead.

/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/optim/lr_scheduler.py:122: UserWarning: Detected call of `lr_scheduler.step()` before `optimizer.step()`. In PyTorch 1.1.0 and later, you should call them in the opposite order: `optimizer.step()` before `lr_scheduler.step()`.  Failure to do this will result in PyTorch skipping the first value of the learning rate schedule. See more details at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate
